# 👋 Hi, I'm Charles Gaughf

Welcome to my corner of GitHub! I'm a cybersecurity engineer with nearly 15 years of professional experience in security architecture, incident response, vulnerability management, and technical leadership — and over 20 years in the broader IT space. I'm passionate about building secure systems, automating defenses, and making security education more accessible.
